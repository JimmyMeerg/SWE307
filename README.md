# SWE 307 Big Data Project 2
Due date: 24 November 2022

In this project you are expected to build an information system that uses big-data tools to scale horizontally.

**Problem definition:** Web based system for online shopping system. Instead of selling products, we are interested in people “likes” and “dislikes”. In the system there will be login page, students in the class will be registered to the system. These registered students can enter anytime, press a button and send their opinions. Reporting page will show us the polling results.
